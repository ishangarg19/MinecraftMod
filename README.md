# MinecraftMod
A Minecraft Mod I created a while ago for Minecraft 1.7.10. It is called the Demeral Mod (combination of diamond and emerald). 
The program cannot be run, as the Gradle and Forge files are lost, but it showcases my programming from camps during elementary
school. The class is functional, and is one of the largest and most complex programs I have ever made.
